```
Write a function that checks if a given value is an instance of a given class or superclass. For this problem, an object is considered an instance of a given class if that object has access to that class's methods.

There are no constraints on the data types that can be passed to the function. For example, the value or the class could be undefined.

## Approach 1: Iterating Through Prototype Chain
Intuition
The problem requires checking if a given object is an instance of a specified class or one of its superclasses. The object is considered an instance of a class if it has access to that class's methods including indirect access through boxing as described in the overview section.

The provided solution focuses on traversing the prototype chain of the given object to determine if it's an instance of the specified class or one of its superclasses. By iterating through the prototype, we can identify if the object has access to the class's methods.

### Algorithm
The checkIfInstanceOf function accepts two parameters: obj (the object to check, possibly could be primitive value) and classFunction (the class to check against). The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. If obj is null or undefined, or classFunction is not a function, return false. This step ensures that the input is valid before proceeding.

2. Initialize a variable currPotentialPrototype with the prototype of obj. The prototype is an object containing the methods and properties accessible by obj.

3. Use a while loop to iterate through the prototype chain of obj. For each iteration, perform the following steps:

> a. Check if currPotentialPrototype is equal to the prototype of classFunction. If so, obj is an instance of classFunction, and the function returns true.

> b. If the prototypes are not equal, move down the prototype chain by setting currPotentialPrototype to the prototype of its current value.

4. If the loop finishes without finding a matching prototype, return false, as obj is not an instance of classFunction or its superclasses in this case.

> Implementation

```Typescript
function checkIfInstanceOf(obj: any, classFunction: any): boolean {
  if (obj === null || obj === undefined || typeof classFunction !== "function")
    return false;

  let currPotentialPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);

  while (currPotentialPrototype !== null) {
    if (currPotentialPrototype === (classFunction as Function).prototype)
      return true;
    currPotentialPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(currPotentialPrototype);
  }

  return false;
};

```

## Approach 2: Built-in instanceof method
Intuition
This alternative solution for this problem simplifies the process of checking if a given object is an instance of a specified class or one of its superclasses. Instead of manually traversing the prototype chain, this solution takes advantage of JavaScript's instanceof operator, which automatically checks the prototype chain to determine if the object is an instance of the specified class.

### Algorithm
The checkIfInstanceOf function accepts two parameters: obj (the object to check) and classFunction (the class to check against). The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. If obj is null or undefined, or classFunction is not a function, return false. This step ensures that the input is valid before proceeding.
2. Use the instanceof operator to check if obj is an instance of classFunction. The instanceof operator checks the prototype chain of obj for the presence of classFunction.prototype. If obj is an instance of classFunction, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Note that we need to account for primitives to be treated essentially as objects or as if they were coming from wrapper constructors due to primitives not having direct access to the prototype from their appropriate constructor as presented in the overview.
> Implementation

```Ts
function checkIfInstanceOf(obj: any, classFunction: any): boolean {
  if (obj === null || obj === undefined || typeof classFunction !== "function")
    return false;

  let inputObj = obj;
  if (typeof obj !== "object") {
    inputObj = Object(obj); // Make sure it's an object so instanceof has direct access to the constructor function
  }
  return inputObj instanceof classFunction;
};

```

## Approach 3: Iterating Through Prototype Chain With Generator Function
Intuition
Similar to Approach 1, this solution also checks if a given object is an instance of a specified class or one of its superclasses by traversing the prototype chain. The difference is that this approach uses a generator function. Generators are lazy in nature, which is especially beneficial when dealing with large data sets or long prototype chains.

### Algorithm
The checkIfInstanceOf function accepts two parameters: obj (the object to check) and classFunction (the class to check against). The algorithm proceeds as follows:

If obj is null or undefined, or classFunction is not a function, return false. This step ensures that the input is valid before proceeding.

Define a generator function prototypeGenerator that yields the prototypes of the given object, starting with its direct prototype and moving down the chain.

Use a for loop to iterate through the prototype chain of obj using the prototypeGenerator function. For each iteration, perform the following steps:

a. Check if the current prototype is equal to the prototype of classFunction. If so, obj is an instance of classFunction, and the function returns true.

If the loop finishes without finding a matching prototype, return false, as obj is not an instance of classFunction or its superclasses.

> Implementation

```Ts
function* prototypeGenerator(obj: any): Generator<any, void, unknown> {
  let currPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);
  while (currPrototype !== null) {
    yield currPrototype;
    currPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(currPrototype);
  }
}

function checkIfInstanceOf(obj: any, classFunction: any): boolean {
  if (obj === null || obj === undefined || typeof classFunction !== "function")
    return false;

  for (const prototype of prototypeGenerator(obj)) {
    if (prototype === (classFunction as Function).prototype) return true;
  }

  return false;
}

```
